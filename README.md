# earthquake-demo

This is a very basic, barebones demo app that pulls in data from a feed hosted by the USGS for earthquakes that have occurred within the last hour.  The data is updated every minute.  This demo is meant to show a sample of my coding style, organization, and skill.  I used Xcode groups rather than folders.  The demo is a simple tableview with tappable cells.  The cells lead to a detail page that displays more information and a map with the location of the earthquake.  I added unit tests as well.
